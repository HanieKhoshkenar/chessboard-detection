# Chessboard Detection

This Python project demonstrates how to detect chessboard corners in an image using OpenCV. It utilizes the `cv2.findChessboardCorners` method to identify and refine the corners of a chessboard pattern, and then visualizes the result.

## Requirements

* Python 3.x
* OpenCV (`cv2`)
* Numpy

You can install the required libraries using:

```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy
```

## How It Works

1. **Image Loading**: The image containing the chessboard is loaded using `cv2.imread`.
2. **Grayscale Conversion**: The image is converted to grayscale for better processing.
3. **Corner Detection**: `cv2.findChessboardCorners` is used to find the chessboard corners, which is crucial for applications like camera calibration or game tracking.
4. **Corner Refinement**: Once corners are detected, they are refined using `cv2.cornerSubPix` for better precision.
5. **Visualization**: The detected corners are drawn on the image using `cv2.drawChessboardCorners`, and the result is displayed in a window.

## Usage

Simply replace `'chess.jpg'` with the path to your image, and run the script. The corners of the chessboard will be displayed on the image.
